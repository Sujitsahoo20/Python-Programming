"""
VARIABLES- 
-Variable is like a container that holds data.
-Very similar to how our containers in kitchens holds sugar, salt etc.
-Creating a variable is like creating a placeholder in memory and assigning it
 some value.

 eg. a = 1
     b = True etc here a and b are container(variable) and 1 and True is value

"""

a = 1
print(a)
b= "Sujit"
print(b)

"""
Data Type-

Data type specifies the type of value a variable holds. This is required in programming to do various
operations without causing an error.

"""

a= 1
print(type(a))  #int

b = True
print(type(b)) #bool

c = "Sujit"
print(type(c)) #str

d = 1.56
print(type(d)) #float
